# Zombie-Flappy-Bird
Remake of the original Flappy Bird via Kilobolt

Join me as I go through Kilobolt's very old, but still very good [tutorial](http://www.kilobolt.com/zombie-bird-tutorial-flappy-bird-remake.html) on Zombie Bird. It goes through a number of fundamentals for LibGDX. I've sorted out the commits to match lessons to an extent. I hope my journey helps forge yours.

Caveats
- This dude uses a lot of magic numbers (A LOT). 
- The tutorials between Day 9 - 12 were basically reading code to match comparisons.
- I didn't copy any of the source code directly until the last day <br> (where I was really just debugging the UI to make it display/work properly).
- File structure isn't ideal, but isn't the worst. (EG - GameRenderer turns out to be massive). 
- Going to put off fixing a lot of UI because it ends up being very difficult <br>sorting through all his magic numbers and where exactly they originate.

Gains
+ Good enough understanding of the library to get started (Really all I wanted).
+ Flexed my spaghetti code reading abilities.
+ it's not pretty (or even mine), but first LibGDX Game âˆš
